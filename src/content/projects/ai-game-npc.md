# AI-Driven NPC Behavior System

An experimental system that uses machine learning to create more realistic and engaging non-player characters in games. NPCs learn and adapt their behaviors based on player interactions and environmental changes.

## Core Components

- **Behavior Trees** for structured decision making
- **Reinforcement Learning** for adaptive responses
- **Personality Modeling** for consistent character traits
- **Unity Integration** for real-time game implementation

## Current Progress

The system successfully demonstrates NPCs that can learn player preferences and adjust their interaction patterns accordingly. Future work includes expanding the emotional modeling system and improving computational efficiency.

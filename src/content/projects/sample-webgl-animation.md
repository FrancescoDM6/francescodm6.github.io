# Interactive 3D Particle System

This project explores real-time particle physics simulation using WebGL and custom GLSL shaders. The system supports:

- **Dynamic particle generation** with customizable emission patterns
- **Real-time physics** including gravity, wind forces, and collision detection
- **Interactive controls** allowing users to manipulate particle behaviors
- **Performance optimization** supporting thousands of particles at 60fps

## Technical Implementation

The particle system uses a combination of vertex and fragment shaders to handle particle positioning and rendering efficiently on the GPU. Each particle maintains state for position, velocity, life span, and visual properties.

## Key Features

- Mouse interaction for force application
- Multiple particle types (fire, smoke, sparks)
- Configurable physics parameters
- Real-time performance metrics display

This project demonstrates advanced WebGL techniques and serves as a foundation for more complex real-time graphics applications.
